SEVER-NODEJS
This mongo db connection is done to prevent creating multiple database connections. In serverless environments (like AWS Lambda, Vercel, etc.), new instances of the application may start frequently, leading to excessive connections to MongoDB if not handled properly.

This code uses ES6 modules (import and export default), which is standard in modern JavaScript and more commonly used in modern React/Next.js apps or TypeScript projects.(intead of CommonJS (require, module.exports))
